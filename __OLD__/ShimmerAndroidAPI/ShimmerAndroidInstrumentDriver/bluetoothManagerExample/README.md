# Bluetooth Manager Example
This example is only applicable for Shimmer3 devices onwards

- This example automatically connects to a shimmer device (see variable shimmerBtAdd in MainActivity), otherwise the connect button can be used to connect to a single shimmer device
- Low Noise Accelerometer and Timestamp data are printed to the logcat when streaming, note there won't be low noise accelerometer data if the sensor is not enabled
